This is my first attempt at a personal website, and I hope it goes well. I was inspired
by an article I read online where someone had a .sh domain that looked nice. I can't find
said article so apologies to whoever that was, but thank you.

There really is no structure or plan for this and I don't think I want there to be, I plan
on using this to keep track things I learn, thoughts I have, books I read (I don't really read
but I probably should) or any other random things. Its a good space to practice my creative
writing, hopefully teach people some things through my discoveries. It feels like I am just rambling
at this point so I'll move on.

A couple of important things (not mentioned in the home page... yet) before I wrap up:
- My name is Gustavo
- I am a software engineer
- There will be plenty of grammatical mistakes and errors, maybe I'll fix them, maybe I won't
- I don't think anyone will ever read this
