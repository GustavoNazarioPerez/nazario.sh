### Updates
Things look a bit different since the last time I made a post

- **NEW**: "SUBSCRIBE" button at the bottom of the site. Sign up to be receive
an email when I add a new post
- **NEW**: Icons that link to my socials
- **UPDATED**: The moon emjois to control light/dark mode have been replaced

This post will be much more technical than the previous two. I'll try my best
to define any jargon.

### Idol

a representation or symbol of an object of worship

Having an idol is a dangerous thing. From my brief research on idols, the one
word that keeps scaring me is "**blindly**". It's surprisingly easy to ignore
someone's flaws when you look up to them.

I think the only idol I've ever had is [David Ortiz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ortiz).
In my eyes, he can do no evil, he was a mythical figure when I was growing up.
If someone showed me the lab results from when he
[tested positive for PEDs](https://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=4366335), I'd
stop believing in science altogether. 

No more idols, lets have role models instead.

### Role Model

~~an American singer-songwriter and former rapper~~[^1]

a person looked to by others as an example to be imitated

That's a lot less scary. 

I (like most people) have had a lot of role models, and today I added one to the
list.

### Mitchell Hashimoto

The next couple of paragraphs will look a lot like what the kids call *glazing* 

Mitchell doesn't have a wikipedia page (he probably should) so I'll link [his
website](https://mitchellh.com)[^2] instead. He co-founded
[HashiCorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HashiCorp), a very succesful software
company and now works on the
[terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) that I am using at 
this very moment, [Ghostty](https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty?tab=readme-ov-file#about).

Neither of those two cool things are enough to make someone a role model, so I
am going to share what about Mitchell makes him a good example to follow.

- Passionate. Has a sh*t ton of money and still codes when he has the time.
- Philanthropic. [Donated $300k of that sh*t ton to the Zig Software Foundation](https://mitchellh.com/writing/zig-donation).
- Seemingly good guy. [Tweet](https://x.com/mitchellh/status/1982559447638777994)
from today speaks for itself.

### I found a role model! What now?

Easy, I start to code *for the passion*, then I'll donate $300k and tweet about
my child (neither of which I have).

No. Start by learning about the behaviors that made them succesful and begin
implementing them as you see fit. **DO NOT** just copy their lifestyle and
start to believe everything they do in the hopes that you will become them, that
is creeping back into *idol* territory.

I've listened to a couple of talks and podcasts that Mr. Hashimoto has done and
here are the main things I have taken from them.

- He is always working on a side project
- He started Ghostty because he wanted to use Zig and learn about something he
didn't have too much familiarity with (terminal emulators).
- He reads the reference/manual/docs and standard library of a programming
language before writing a single line of code.

I recently started a side project (this site) and have been going back and
forth with the theme so I am going to make my own. Side project ✅

I don't have much experience using Hugo or frontend development. Opportunity
for learning ✅

Time to read a bunch of stuff.

### Final Thoughts

Everyone is their own person and you should never try to be someone else, but it
is okay (maybe even encouraged) to learn from and admire *certain aspects of* others.

If anyone has any thoughts or ideas on how to make this site better please let
me know.

I'll leave you with a quote about idolization that a wise friend of mine
named Noah said 7-ish years ago (I have no clue why I still remember this).

[^1]: This was a joke. If you haven't heard ROLE MODEL's music, give it a listen.
[Apple Music](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/role-model/199215762),
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/1dy5WNgIKQU6ezkpZs4y8z?trackId=03zWQa4ZQEMofug2Gmh6io),
Google it if you use something else.

[^2]: No I did not copy his site. I wish mine looked that good.
