### You've been warned
There is some suspense in this post, so scroll down ***slowly***. If you're
going to click on footnotes, press the return arrow to come back instead of
scrolling all the way up.

### For Future Reference:
Although this has the same date as [my first blog](/posts/my-first-post),
that's only because it was one of those late at night, 12 AM type of posts.
Fear not, it truly is a new day (hence the again).

### Housekeeping
A discussion about the current/future state of this site before we *truly* get started.
- I'm gonna switch the ðŸŒ• to something else, I think it looks great but I'd
like to make it more unique
- I thought of adding search functionality to have the ability to look back on
previous posts but searching the files on my computer is easy enough [^1].
- I'll probably get a little logo for the tab bar
- I NEED to add contect info. How else will strangers be able to reach me?

I spent the day around beautiful fall foliage, did some hiking, some
picture taking, some train riding, some jigsaw puzzle buying, some movie watching,
the usual. I don't think I want this to be about stuff I did, is that interesting
enough? Does it have to be? Who cares?

I have somewhat of an audience at this point (4 people?) so I want to think about
them before just writing stuff but maybe that defeats the whole purpose of this.
Enough meta-blogging, lets write about something interesting or at the very least
entertaining [^2]

Today I learned about how protobufs perform binary encoding, but anyone can just
[read about that](https://protobuf.dev/programming-guides/encoding/) and I don't
know that I understand it enough to do an
[ELI5](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/) type of thing so let's talk
about the jigsaw puzzle I bought.

Some years back I interned with friends that said they enjoyed drinking wine
and doing a jigsaw puzzle. At the time I thought, "that doesn't seem too fun, wine
is gross", but now it sounds delightful (apart from the whole wine thing). There
is just *something* doing a puzzle with a candle going while all your friends are
hanging out without you that just does it for me [^3]. 

Well anyways, fast forward (flashback?) to about a year ago, I completed my first
1000 piece puzzle ([here](https://www.galison.com/products/uncovering-new-york-city-search-and-find-1000-piece-puzzle?srsltid=AfmBOoomEnvkgF2lp1-SJtgAOlhb-NpqyUcyTXfHt6nc5cLkxojD94E3)) in some time.
Today I went into a games/puzzles store with the hopes of getting another, but
what should it be?

The last puzzle I bought was a fun, colorful depiction of New York City, it
only made sense, I had just moved here! The problem is, ALL THE COOL
PUZZLES ARE NYC THEMED [^4]!!! In 20 years I don't want a closet full of NYC themed
puzzles, I wanted to switch it up.

**ENTERING THE ZONE OF SUSPENSE**

I debated over puzzles with: 
- frog species
- dog breeds
- a woman golfing with a beaver? 

But ultimately chose...

Oops, I did it again.

In all seriousness though, this was just too cool to refuse. Maybe one day
I'll turn my back on the city and do a random jigsaw puzzle, today is not that day. 

[^1]: At the end of the day this site if just files on both
[GitHub](https://github.com/GustavoNazarioPerez/nazario.sh) and my laptop so using
something like [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) does the trick.

[^2]: I understand if you stopped reading by this point. Is this how
footnotes were even meant to be used?

[^3]: Anyone who doesn't know me has to think I'm over 70 right?

[^4] The puzzles didn't necessarily scream NYC but most are magazine covers of 
"[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker)".
